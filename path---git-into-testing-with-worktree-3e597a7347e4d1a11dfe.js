A new working tree is created in the directory specified in the command and associated it\'s with the repository. This new working tree is called a "linked working tree" as opposed to the "main working tree" resulting from "git init" or "git clone". every git repository has one "main" working tree association (assuming it\'s not a special case like a bare repository) and any number (0-whatever) associated "linked" working trees.</p>',frontmatter:{date:"July 12, 2017",path:"/git-into-testing-with-worktree",title:"Git into testing with worktree"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
